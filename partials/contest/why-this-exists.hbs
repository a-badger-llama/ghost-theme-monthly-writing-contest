            <p>This contest exists to help writers finish work, get thoughtful feedback, and see their stories published.</p>
            <p>Every entry receives detailed feedback. We use AI to provide consistent, constructive notes on craft, structure, and voice—the kind of response most submissions never get. The top entries are then reviewed by human judges who select the winners.</p>
            <p>The entry fee is $5. It keeps the contest sustainable and ensures every submission gets the attention it deserves.</p>
