            <p>Good writing deserves a serious audience. This contest exists to find stories that stick with you after you've finished reading them.</p>
            <p>Every submission is read by a human. We don't use automated screening. We don't favor established names. We're looking for the story itself: the voice, the precision, the thing only you could have written.</p>
            <p>If your story is selected, it will be published here and shared with readers who care about craft.</p>
